Example: Add a "Particle Explosion" visualizer

Create a visualizer where particles explode from the center when bass hits.
- Particles should be colored based on frequency (rainbow)
- Particles should fade out as they move away from center
- Use additive blending for glow effect
- Should be a Milkdrop-style mode (feedback zoom)
